Project plan
=======================================================================

--------

*Target a specific area for improvement.*

Exploratory analysis.
 
Measurable 
----------

Identify some things that we CANNOT do with this data set.

Assignable 
----------

*Specify who will do it.*

Realistic 
---------

*State what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.*

Currently, this actually seems to be similar to 'measurable'; ie, what is realistic is what CAN be done as opposed to what CANNOT be done.

Time related 
------------

*Specify when the result(s) can be achieved.*

- Deadline?
